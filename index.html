            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="color:white">Hello! My name is Jason Yadegari and I am a recent graduate of California State University, East Bay with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I also hold an Associate of Science in Computer Information Systems from Mission College in Santa Clara, CA.</p>
                
            <p style="color:white">Currently, I am working as a Autonomous Vehicle QA Tester at NVIDIA via Trillium Staffing. I previously worked as a Robotics QA Tester at Everyday Robots via Virtusa in Mountain View, CA, where I have gained hands-on experience in testing robotic software and hardware, reporting bugs, and providing detailed feedback to engineering teams. I have executed various forms of testing, including validation, smoke, and regression tests, and have identified product weaknesses and proposed improvements.</p>
                
            <p style="color:white">In the past, I have worked as a Programming Instructor at Applied Computing Foundation in Santa Clara, CA, where I taught classes of students ranging from elementary to high school levels in robotics, game creation, and a variety of programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I effectively developed and implemented curriculum and collaborated with team members to develop new effective teaching methods and curriculum.</p>
                
            <p style="color:white">Additionally, I have experience working in customer service and administrative roles, including as a Store Floor Leader and Photo Specialist at Walgreens in Campbell, CA. I am proficient in Python and C++ programming, have basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and SQL, and am experienced in Linux, Windows, and MacOS environments.</p>
                
            <p style="color:white">I am interested in gaining experience in software development and have included some of my web projects in my portfolio. With my excellent prioritizing, planning, and time-management skills, ability to work independently and as part of a team, and strong attention to detail, I am confident in my ability to deliver high-quality and accurate work. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!
